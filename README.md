### Lesson 4: HTML Lists - Classwork Assignment

#### **Objective:**

Building upon the webpage created in **Lesson 4**, students will implement ordered and unordered lists to structure information hierarchically. This classwork will help students demonstrate their understanding of the `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` tags in organizing content effectively.

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Open Your Existing HTML File**:

   - Open the `index.html` file you created in the `unit02-cw` folder.
   - You will now enhance this file by adding ordered and unordered lists to structure information.

2. **Add an Unordered List to the Hobbies Section**:

   - Inside the `<main>` tag, go to the **"My Hobbies"** section and convert the list of hobbies into an unordered list (`<ul>`). Each hobby should be wrapped in a list item (`<li>`):
     ```html
     <div>
       <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Reading books</li>
         <li>Coding</li>
         <li>Playing video games</li>
         <li>Hiking</li>
       </ul>
     </div>
     ```

3. **Add an Ordered List for a "Daily Routine" Section**:

   - Below the **"About Me"** section and above the **"My Hobbies"** section, add a new section titled **"My Daily Routine"**. Use an ordered list (`<ol>`) to describe your daily activities. Each activity should be wrapped in a list item (`<li>`):
     ```html
     <section>
       <h3>My Daily Routine</h3>
       <ol>
         <li>Wake up and have breakfast</li>
         <li>Check my emails and messages</li>
         <li>Work on my web development projects</li>
         <li>Go for a walk in the afternoon</li>
         <li>Read or play video games in the evening</li>
       </ol>
     </section>
     ```

4. **Enhance the "Related Articles" in the Aside with an Unordered List**:

   - Inside the `<aside>` tag, convert the "Related Articles" section into an unordered list (`<ul>`) for better organization. Each article should be wrapped in a list item (`<li>`):
     ```html
     <aside>
       <h3>Related Articles</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Why Learn HTML?</li>
         <li>CSS for Beginners</li>
         <li>JavaScript Basics</li>
       </ul>
     </aside>
     ```

5. **Ensure Correct Usage of Lists**:

   - The unordered list (`<ul>`) should be used for items that don't follow a particular order (e.g., hobbies, related articles), while the ordered list (`<ol>`) should be used for items that have a logical sequence (e.g., daily routine).
   - Ensure the lists are correctly nested within the appropriate sections.

6. **Save and Preview Your Webpage**:

   - Save your `index.html` file.
   - Open it in a browser to ensure the ordered and unordered lists are displaying as expected and that the webpage remains well-structured.

7. **Submit Your Work**:
   - Once you've confirmed the webpage works as expected, submit the following:
     - The zipped `unit02-cw` folder with the updated `index.html` file.
   - Upload it to the classwork assignment on Google Classroom.

### **Assessment Criteria**:

1. **Correct Use of List Tags**:

   - The webpage uses unordered lists (`<ul>`) and ordered lists (`<ol>`) correctly to organize content.
   - List items (`<li>`) are used appropriately within their respective lists.

2. **Logical Content Organization**:

   - The hobbies are now presented in a bulleted unordered list.
   - The daily routine is presented in a numbered ordered list.
   - The related articles are displayed in an unordered list in the aside section.

3. **File Structure and Submission**:
   - The HTML file is well-organized and properly formatted.
   - The updated file is submitted properly along with the rest of the `unit02-cw` folder.
